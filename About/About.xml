--- Original Description ---
Adds ability to dynamically add and remove regularly scheduled events.
Set up the events in Options -&gt; Mod Setttings -&gt; Scheduled Events.

Much like when creating a scenario and choosing create incident, but this has a few more options, like starting the event after a specific time, and change settings on the run during a game.

Works with existing saves.</description>
